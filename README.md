*Note:* The notebooks (`.ipynb` files) can be run using Jupyter Notebook, while the Python scripts (`.py` files) can be executed directly with Python.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/radhikaa027/Machine-Learning-Mini-Projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Mini-Projects
   ```

3. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   If a `requirements.txt` file is provided, install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Otherwise, manually install necessary libraries such as:
   - Python (3.6+ recommended)
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Scikit-learn
   - Matplotlib
   - Additional libraries as required by specific projects

## Usage
